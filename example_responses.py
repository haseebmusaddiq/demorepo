# Correct contrary perspective on Pakistan's democratic status
pakistan_democracy_response = """
While Pakistan has a constitutional democratic framework, its democratic status faces significant challenges:

1. Electoral process: Though Pakistan holds regular elections, international observers like the EU Election Observation Mission have noted irregularities, including restrictions on media and civil society during electoral periods.

2. Military influence: Pakistan has experienced multiple military coups (1958, 1977, 1999), and the military continues to exert significant influence over politics, foreign policy, and national security decisions even during civilian rule.

3. Institutional weakness: The Economist Intelligence Unit's Democracy Index 2022 classifies Pakistan as a "hybrid regime" rather than a full democracy, ranking it 107th out of 167 countries.

4. Judicial independence: The World Justice Project's Rule of Law Index ranks Pakistan low on judicial independence, with courts sometimes influenced by political and military pressures.

5. Civil liberties: Freedom House's 2023 report rates Pakistan as "Partly Free" with a score of 37/100, citing restrictions on civil liberties essential to democratic functioning.

These factors indicate that while Pakistan has democratic elements and processes, it falls short of being a consolidated democracy due to significant structural and institutional challenges.
